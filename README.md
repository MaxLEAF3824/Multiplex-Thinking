## Overview

This repository contains the **official implementation** of **Multiplex Thinking: Reasoning via Token-wise Branch-and-Merge**.

Multiplex Thinking proposes a **token-wise branch-and-merge reasoning mechanism**, enabling efficient and expressive multi-pat reasoning while maintaining a compact token representation.

The codebase is built upon several high-quality open-source projects. We sincerely thank the original authors and contributors for their outstanding work.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Environment Setup

We strongly recommend using **Docker** to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment.

For general system configuration, please refer to the official documentation:

- https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workers/sglang_worker.html

### Base Docker Image

We suggest starting from the official **verl SGLang worker** Docker image:

- https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/325cbc770bfe32ef022f1cd67feab1a23bba9e42/docker/verl0.5-cu126-torch2.7-fa2.7.4/Dockerfile.app.sglang0.4.9.post6.mcore0.13

### Dependencies

Please ensure the following package versions are installed:

- `sglang == 0.4.9.post6`
- `transformers == 4.54.0`

### Setup

Run the setup script:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```
    The `setup.sh` script handles the installation of required dependencies and ensures the correct versions of our customized libraries are active by running:
    * `pip install sglang-0.4.9.post6`
    * `pip install transformers-4.54.0`

### Training and evaluation

Train and evaluate by running 
`bash scripts/train.sh` or `bash scripts/eval.sh`

### Implementation Credits
This codebase is built upon and inspired by the exceptional work from the following projects:
* **Training & RL Framework**: [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) & [DeepScaleR](https://github.com/agentica-project/DeepScaleR)
* **Inference Engine**: [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)
* **Conceptual Foundation**: [Soft Thinking](https://github.com/eric-ai-lab/Soft-Thinking)
